### Task: TOP 9 LARGEST COUNTRIES BY POPULATION

Hello! In this task, you need to parse data from the list, and based on it get the average and total value.
You no need to change styles or HTML layout in this task. Change only `main.js` file.

Steps to do this challenge:
[x] Get all text data from `span` with class `population`
[x] Make sure that the given string can be converted to a number and convert it to number.
[x] Calculate average and total value-based to parsed numbers.
[x] Replace `Calculate it!` with calculated average numbers in `span` with classes `average-population` and `total-population`.
[x] Calculated `average` and `total` numbers must be separated by a thousands separator (same numeric style as populations presented).

Congrats, mate! You did it!
